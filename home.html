                        Programming, also known as coding or software development, is the process of designing, writing, testing, and maintaining computer programs or software applications. It involves instructing a computer to perform specific tasks by providing it with a set of instructions written in a programming language. These instructions are then translated by a compiler or interpreter into machine code that the computer can understand and execute.
